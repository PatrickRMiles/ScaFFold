@numba.njit
def generate_fractal_points(params: np.array, numpoints: int):
    """
    Generate fractal points from an IFS, using jit compilation for significant speedup.

    Assumes `params` is a 2x13 array where:
      - Columns 0-8: 3x3 matrix coefficients.
      - Columns 9-11: translation components.
      - Column 12: normalized probability for transformation 0 (transformation 1's probability is 1 - p).

    Note that, due to finite floating point precision, the fractal point generation
    process sometimes exhibits runaway values. Numba jit compilation does not play well
    with error handling, so we omit the runaway scaling check that the `_slow` version of
    this function has. A fractal point cloud which had runaway scaling will fail the other
    quality checks, so we're safe to omit this runaway scaling error handling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    params : np.array
        A numpy array containing the IFS parameters for this fractal category attempt.
    numpoints : int
        The number of fractal points to generate.

    Returns
    -------
    points : np.array
        A numpy array of fractal points for this attempt.
    runaway_check_pass : bool
        A bool: False if runaway values were found when generating fractal points; True otherwise.
